    <h1>Peer Tutor Reflection</h1>
    <p>
      As this is the second time being a peer tutor, I will save the part where I demonstrate my understanding of what a peer tutor is, but rather discuss about what
      I've further explored in my continued journey this semester as a peer tutor. Compared to last year, there were definately more work load. One of my biggest successes 
      as a peer tutor this year in band class was building strong connections with the students I worked with. I found that even small bits of encouragement or constructive feedback 
      helped boost their confidence and motivation. Seeing their musical growth and knowing that I played a role in it was incredibly rewarding. However, a major challenge was finding 
      the right balance between helping and stepping back. Some students needed guidance but also needed space to explore and make mistakes on their own. Sometimes I even think that I
      might be scaring the students a little, which caused them to make mistakes. And therefore, I had to constantly adapt my approach for different students. I didn't have to do that 
      too much, though, since I only worked with a few students individually. <br><br>
      What I learned as a peer tutor, especially in band, was that students rarely asks questions. In normal academic classes, reasons could be peer pressure, self-esteem, or simply
      the lack of courage. But, in band, it's all these things doubled (becasue they are 2x amount of students) plus a tight agenda during classes. Studnets may be reluctant to ask for
      help because they are no time for individual support from the teacher -- and that's when a peer tutor should step in. For many times, it takes the teacher quite a bit to find out 
      what is not sounding right and adjusting it often takes a long time; that's not what the band teachers want. Thus, the existence of another band teacher, and peer tutors, can deal
      with individuals or small groups of students, while the big group is progressing at the same time. The peer tutor alawys helps establish efficiency and effectiveness in band.
      <br><br>
      Nevertheless, this experience somewhat reshaped how I approach my own practice. I became more intentional with my playing because I knew others were looking to me as a model. I also became more 
      reflective and analytical; I started thinking about why something worked or didn’t work, which helped me grow as a musician and a leader. With that being said, I successfully composed
      a piece for concert band. We were going to perform it at the year end concert, but it was unfortunately replaced by another song. At least we got to play it a few times.
      <br><br>
      Last but not least, to add on from last years, some more advice for future peer tutors:<br>
      Be patient and listen, because your presence and attitude can impact more than your words. Focus on being a role model, not just in your subject but in how you carry yourself. Don’t be afraid to ask 
      your teacher for support, and remember that helping others will also help you grow. Most of all, enjoy the process, which I'm certain that you will. You’ll be surprised how much you’ll 
      learn from your peers, and how much they'll learn from you.
