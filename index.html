      <h2>General Comments</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout this peer tutoring journey, I developed both my mastery in music and interpersonal communication skills.
        Each session presented unique challenges and learning moments, helping me grow as both a tutor and a learner.

        I am very very glad that a few of my peer tutoring students from last year (Math 10), including but not limited to Brianna, Ian, and Shannon, took initiative and became peer tutors themselves this year. (Shoutout to Brianna who was
        also peer tutoring in the music program! I hope she enjoyed working with the Grade 8s. I was about to teach the 8s, but the teachers decided to put me in block C, which is the
        9 and 10s, whom are also wonderful groups of students)
        <br>
        <br>
        Below are snapshots from this experience, some with a meaningful story behind it.

          <h3>First Conducting Session</h3>
          <p>
            This photo captures the first time I led the whole class. I conducted the grade 9 concert band through a few scales and warmup songs. It was overall a wonderful
            experience, since it was my first chance to meet everyone in the band together.

          <h3>Group Photo</h3>
          <p>
             I had a selfie taken with the Band 9 students after my conducting session; it was after then when many of these student starts to greet me in hallways and classrooms. Though I want to
            seek improvement from them in terms of music skills, I still primarily try to be nice and bond with them -- which was a great decision. Managing 70 students at once is exceptionally
            difficult. Along with the grade 10s, compared to last year, it is 4x of names I have to remember.

          <h3>"Paperwork"</h3>
          <p>
            As a peer tutor in band, we don't spend all our time dealing with students. In fact, we don't get to work with many students for the majority of time. This picture shows all the
            band music that I helped organizing upstairs on the shelf. My knowledge of excel has contributed greatly in improving the efficiency of this work.

          <h3>The Office</h3>
          <p>
            About 40% of my time being a peer tutor this semester was spent inside this little room, the music office. I do lots sort of stuff: Sorting and tracking parent consent forms;
            help the choir write warm ups; enter student grades from playing tests; keep track of student info; cleaning a teacher's chair for the chocolate stain from another peer tutor :(

          <h3>Preconcert Get-ready</h3>
          <p>
            I took this photo while charging all the stand lights for our year end concert. We usually do it a day or two before the concert to ensure all the lights work well for the 
            performing bands. This was taken place in the practice room, the room where I spent my other 40% in. And yes, the remaining 20% goes to the band room and the attic above
            the room, where I did my conducting and organizing of music.

          <h3>The Practice Room</h3>
          <p>
            This is another prespective of the practice room, but without the piano. Usually, my 1 on 1 sessions are in here and I use the piano to help the students find notes. Something
            that I did in this room as well, was sorting all the items for the silent auction for our Jazz and Java Event this Spring. I spent over 15 hours just in this room, taking up my
            lunch and spare blocks as well to make sure everything is organized. After the aution, I was also in charge of sorting the unsold items, which took another few days to do.

          <h3>Holistic View of the Band Room</h3>
          <p>
            This is a Bird's-eye view of our band room, taken from the attic. It shows how big(or small) the band room is. The students downstairs make up the grade 10 concert band,
          which has less numbers than the 9s, making the room look less crowded. Analogy figures of instruments with red background frams can be seen on the walls, but I doubt anyone 
            actually looks at them

          <h3>What's Upstairs</h3>
          <p>
            This is the attic, where students store their instruments (Except for the Tuba and percussion instruments since they are stored downstairs in the room). It isn't a big space but
            many other important things are kept up here - Band Music Scores, Cases... and drinks/snacks for parties/events.

            This photo was secretly taken during my instruction. This is Niki, my assigned student earlier this semester. He is new to the instrument and has his own was of understanding
            towards the score and fingering. I enjoyed working with him and now he is able to strive on the Baritone Saxophone. He also awarded for Outstanding Progress at our concert
            last week (June 12). I think that is not only an achievement for him, but also a great recognition to me.

          <p>
            It's Ms. Smith and Mr. Han. Two very supportive, professional, and kind teachers. Ms.Smith focused more on the well being of the band; she often likes me to play along. 
            On the other hand, Mr. Han also prioritzed the experience for a peer tutors by being more hands-off. I had chances to conduct, to help more students, and to stay with the 
            percussion for some time to help with the rhythm. They gave me many opportunities to improve and take lead as a peer tutor. I thank them for all their help and endorsement.

            Both videos are from my peer tutoring classes. The one above is from the Grade 9s and the one below is from the Grade 10s. The grade 9s performed "The Clapping Song" by
            Standrige, while the 10s played excerpts from the musical "Les Miserables." PS: I'll be conducting the grade 9s for "The Clapping Song" for their upcoming concert at 
            Pacific Heights Elementary on June 17th. (I was gonna do it at the concert but Ms. Smith said that the student needed more practice therefore it wasn't ready just then).

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            Being part of peer tutoring again was an excellent decisioin. Thank you to both teachers, for giving me a chance, though delaved a few times, to conduct, and moreover, a chance for my music composition to be played.
            It makes my days of effort feel worthy. Last but not least, I want to express my regret for not qualifying the music award. l thought that if l tried hardenough in band, PT, and choir, l will still 
            havethe chance to be the first music student in GHS to get it though given I'm not interested/involved in iazz. Perhaps l needed to show more :(. l hope for the upcoming years, students striving in concert 
            band and choir could also be awarded, not only iazz students. Anyways, l sincerely appreciate the time with all peers and teachers. Thank you for making my high school music experience so unforgettable.
